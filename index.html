                    <p>
                        Growing up in a not-tech-savvy environment, I used to love computers so much. I can still recall my first encounter with
                        the computer. My uncle took me to his friend’s office for some business meeting. While they were
                        busy with other things, the friend asked me if I had the time, he would like for me to help type
                        a quick document.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I did not hesitate to embrace the idea even though I knew that I will not complete the document but that was an opportunity
                        that I could not let pass by. After all, that was going to be my first experience with the computer
                        and I was going to have a story for my buddies at school. With a mixture of joy and curiosity, I
                        sat there poking around and pressing anything my fingers would reach. Like a cat checking to see
                        if a mouse is dead or still alive. I touched every key on the keyboard just to see what would have
                        happen. After almost an hour, I had only managed to type few sentences but yes that was an experience
                        that lives on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My philosophy as an upcoming developer that is, “if I can dream it, I can build it.” This philosophy has been carrying me
                        through this newly found love and passion called “coding”. Technology has always been my interest
                        and I am glad that I can finally have the opportunity to do what I like. Can you believe that most
                        of my dreams these days are all about coding? No kidding, I am even debugging in my dreams and applying
                        the solutions when I wake up. Isn’t that amazing? My dream is to build something that will change
                        the world for the better.
